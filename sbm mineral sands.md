Base Resources &#187 About Mineral Sands About Mineral Sands.The mineral sands industry consists of two core product streams: titanium minerals (also referred to as titanium dioxide ore feedstocks or TiO2 ore feedstocks) and zircon.Titanium minerals (ilmenite,leucoxene and rutile) are generally far more prevalent in mineral sand ore bodies than zircon.
