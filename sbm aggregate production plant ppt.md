What is Aggregate Planning ? Importance and its Strategies Aggregate planning is an operational activity critical to the organization as it looks to balance longterm strategic planning with short term production success.Following factors are critical before an aggregate planning process can actually start A complete information is required about available production facility and raw materials. COST EVALUATION OF PRODUCING DIFFERENT this research physical properties of aggregate and stages involve in aggregate production were discussed.Also,structured questionnaires were distributed to the mangers and other management staff in the selected quarries to acquire the total cost impliion of producing 1 ton of granite aggregate. The Production Function Boundless Economics In economics,a production function relates physical output of a production process to physical inputs or factors of production.It is a mathematical function that relates the maximum amount of output that can be obtained from a given number of inputs generally capital and labor.
