Reference Limestone is one of the two key components required to make cement the other is clay.To make cement powder,limestone and clay are ground into a powder,mixed together in the proper proportions and then fed into a rotary kiln,which heats the raw materials to around 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit. Lime in Soil Stabilization Global Road Technology Lime in soil stabilization can be in the form of quicklime (calcium oxide),hydrated lime (calcium hydroxide),or lime slurry.Quicklime is obtained through a chemical transformation of calcium carbonate (limestone) into calcium oxide.
