GOVERNMENT OF INDIA IBM 20141130&ensp&#0183&enspElemental chromium (Cr) does not occur in nature,but is present in ores,primarily chromite (FeOCr 2 O 3).Chromite is an iron chromium oxide mineral and the only ore of chromium metal.Chromite is a metal used to induce hardness,toughness and chemical resistance in steel.The alloy produced is known as "stainless steel". Chromium Minerals Eduion Coalition Chromium (Cr) is a hard,bluish metallic element.The only ore of chromium is the mineral chromite and 99 percent of the world's chromite is found in southern Africa and Zimbabwe.Geologists estimate that there are about 11 billion tons of mineable chromite ore in the world,enough to supply the current demand for hundreds of years.
