The role of sodium sulfide in the flotation of pyrite In coppergold flotation plants,pyrite which is depressed in copper flotation is often floated subsequently with the addition of sodium sulfide (Na 2 S) to recover the associated gold.For the first time,this study investigated the role of Na 2 S responsible for the flotation of pyrite depressed in chalcopyrite flotation through flotation tests and CyroXPS (Xray photoelectron spectroscopy HOW TO Tell the Difference Between Real Gold and Fool's Gold shines at any angle,not just when the &quotlight is right&quot.HARDNESS: Get a piece of copper and try to scratch the copper with the gold.If it scratches it's pyrite.Pyrite is harder than copper.If you do have real gold,be careful with this test.You wouldn't want to damage a beautiful gold nugget!
