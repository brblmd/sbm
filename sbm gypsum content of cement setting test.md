Cement Wikipedia A cement is a binder,a substance used for construction that sets,hardens,and adheres to other materials to bind them together.There are two main forms of cement: Geopolymer cement and Portland Cement.Cement is seldom used on its own,but rather to bind sand and gravel together.Cement mixed with fine aggregate produces mortar for masonry,or with sand and gravel,produces concrete. Cement composition and classifiion PetroWiki These materials are blended together,either wet or dry,and fed into a rotary kiln,which fuses the limestone slurry at temperatures ranging from 2,600 to 3,000&#176F into a material called cement clinker.After it cools,the clinker is pulverized and blended with a small amount of gypsum to control the setting time of the finished cement.

The effect of the source of cement SO3 on the expansion of Sample 1: It was sampled from certified cement (CEM I 52.5 R) according to the European standard EN 197.The manufacturer use natural gypsum as setting regulator.Since the natural gypsum is to be considered as the lower risky regulator of setting,we selected the sample that contained the higher amount of SO 3 for the test. The role of gypsum in the production of cement? The gypsum content of cement is expressed in terms of its sulphate (SO3) content.The retardation mechanism of gypsum is: when cement is hydrated,gypsum reacts with C3A quickly to generate.
