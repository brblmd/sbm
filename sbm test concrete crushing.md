A high watercement ratio will result in a concrete with reduced strength. Concrete slump test Wikipedia The concrete slump test is known as &quotStandard Test Method for Slump of HydraulicCement Concrete&quot and carries the code (ASTM C 143) or (AASHTO T 119).United Kingdom and mainland Europe.In the United Kingdom,the standards specify a slump cone height of 300 mm,a bottom diameter of 200 mm and a top diameter of 100 mm.
