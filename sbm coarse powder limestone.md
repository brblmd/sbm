Types of Lime and What to Look For Encap This type of lime is a more coarse limestone,because it spreads better out of agricultural spreaders.This powder lime is beneficial because it breaks down quickly and acts fast.Liquid lime is a method of applying lime in more industrial applications,such as a road side,or golf course,when a hydroseeder is utilized. The chemistry of limestone Students take about half a dozen small (about 1cm3) lumps of limestone.They examine the stone and describe briefly its colour,texture and any other notable features such as fossils.The colour of a piece of limestone may be misleading.For example coarse brown limestones may be wrongly described as sandstones.
