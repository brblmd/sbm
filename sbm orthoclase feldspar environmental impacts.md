What is Feldspar? Industrial Minerals Association Feldspar minerals are essential components in igneous,metamorphic and sedimentary rocks,to such an extent that the classifiion of a number of rocks is based upon feldspar content.The mineralogical composition of most feldspars can be expressed in terms of the ternary system Orthoclase (KAlSi3O8),Albite (NaAlSi3O8) and Anorthite (CaAl2Si2O8).
