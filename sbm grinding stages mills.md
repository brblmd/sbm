Ball Mill Ball mills tumble iron or steel balls with the ore.The balls are initially 5 10 cm diameter but gradually wear away as grinding of the ore proceeds.The feed to ball mills (dry basis) is typically 75 vol. % ore and 25% steel.The ball mill is operated in closed circuit with a particle size measurement device and size control cyclones. 5 Ways To Improve Grinding Efficiency Of Ball Mills News. Also,because ball mill performance is closely related to complete size distribution of the feed materials,all the previous stages of classification and grinding the materials into smaller sizes which would eventually influence feed size distribution will ultimately affect the grinding efficiency of the ball mill.
