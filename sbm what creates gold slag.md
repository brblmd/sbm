A Comparative Study of Physicochemical and Mineralogical Finer size LD slag particles were examined under the FESEM.The LD slag particles were first made conductive for current and then coated with an extremely thin layer (1.53.0 nm) of gold or gold palladium.The coated LD slag particles were examined and the FESEM images were captured on both photomicrographs and digital files. Metal Profile: Iron Properties and Characteristics Iron was likely originally discovered and extracted as a result of wood burning on top of ironcontaining ores.The carbon within the wood would have reacted with the oxygen in the ore,leaving a soft,malleable iron metal.Iron smelting and the use of iron to make tools and weapons began in Mesopotamia (presentday Iraq) between 2700 and 3000 BC.
