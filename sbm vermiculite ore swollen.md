Why Vermiculite Minerals Are Famous forestguidedtours Expanded vermiculite is obtained by exfoliation or thermal expansion that consists of heating the natural mineral to a temperature ranging from 540˚C to 810˚C.The exfoliation process converts the dense flakes of ore into lightweight and porous granules [5].In its expanded form,vermiculite is chemically active and biologically inert [8] [9].
