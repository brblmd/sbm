Calorific value CS Indonesian Thermal Coal Index The heating value or calorific value of a substance,usually a fuel or food,is the amount of heat released during the combustion of a specified amount of it.The calorific value is a characteristic for each substance.It is measured in units of energy per unit of the substance,usually mass,such as: kcal kg,kJ kg,J mol,Btu m&#179.

Advanced Coal Science Coal Marketing International Advanced Coal Science Coal How It Is Formed.Coal is made from Peat that has been compressed and then subjected to high temperature ( + 100&#176 Celcius) for a few million years to drive off moisture,methane and carbon dioxide bearing molecules. Coal Basics Coal Marketing International Coal Basics What is coal? Coal is a solid fossil hydrocarbon that represents the storage of solar energy from the past in the form of preserved plant material.The plants during the preservation process have been broken down into organic matter that comprises moisture,ash,volatile matter (gases and liquids given off on heating) and fixed carbon.
