The chemistry of limestone The chemistry of the reactions is as follows: Heating the limestone (calcium carbonate) drives off carbon dioxide gas leaving behind lime,the base calcium oxide.CaCO3(s) → CaO(s) + CO2(g).The lime is white and will have a more crumbly texture than the original limestone.Calcium carbonate does not react with water.[ ]The chemistry of the reactions is as follows: Heating the limestone (calcium carbonate) drives off carbon dioxide gas leaving behind lime,the base calcium oxide.CaCO3(s) → CaO(s) + CO2(g).The lime is white and will have a more crumbly texture than the original limestone.Calcium carbonate does not react with water.
