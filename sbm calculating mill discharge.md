How to calculate battery runtime when design equipment A rule of thumb is that for a 1 hour discharge rate (i.e.drawing 10 amps from a 10 amp hour battery,or 1C) you will only get half of the rated capacity (or 5 amphours from a 10 amphour battery).Charts that detail this effect for different discharge rate can be used for greater accuracy.
