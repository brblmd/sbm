An Experimental Archaeological Study on Iron Sand the iron sand compound consisted of magnetite and hematite.A type of iron sand was magnetite because peaks of magnetite were stronger (Fig.2(b)).On the surface of iron ingot (Fig.3(a)) produced after iron sand smelting,pearlites whose composition was almost of eutectoid,were found,and the contents of carbon titanium magnetite sand bgberlin titanium magnetite tio supremewheels.Akome iron sand contains a comparatively high quantity of impurities and ferrotitanium iron ore,and exhibits basicity.Parent rock types include basalt,andesite,aplite,diorite,and granodiorite.Titanium magnetite is formed by a combination of magnetite Black Sands Processing &#171; TCB Metals and Refining We Process Black Sands.Due to the heavy iron content of black sands,most processors,smelters and refineries are unable to process them.We have a unique chemistry that allows us to aggressively process precious metals at 20 mesh and below in less than one hour,so we can effectively leach black sands without dissolving the majority of their iron content. Options for removing TiO2 from iron sands The alternative is to attempt a plasma smelting method to produce TiO2 rich slag (from which titanium can be extracted),pig iron and FeTiC composite.Fine magnetite powder with petroleum coke is directly smelted in a plasma reactor where,as for preparation of FeTiC composite,fine magnetite powder,thoroughly mixed with the requisite Dealing with Black Sands: getting all the gold out of your Capturing the Gold.most of black sand is made up of two crystalline oxides of iron: magnetite and hematite.Hematite has a density of 5.3,and magnetite a density of 5.2.so perhaps the next question is "where is all this black sand coming from?"
