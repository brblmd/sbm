Concrete countertops are extremely cool and trendy immediately for their commercial really good looks.They're also sturdy,and economical reviewed to wellknown materials like quarta movement or marble.Having said Project on Partial Replacement of Cement with Marble Powder In this project our main objective is to study the influence of partial replacement of cement with marble powder,and to compare it with the compressive and tensile strength of ordinary M20 concrete.We are also trying to find the percentage of marble powder replaced in concrete that makes the strength of the concrete maximum. Pros and Cons of a Concrete Driveway The Spruce Concrete is a composite material made up of various types of stone aggregate that are held together with a mixture of water and limebased binderâ€”usually Portland cement.The cement itself is a pulverized powder made from limestone and clay.The size of the aggregate in the concrete mixture can vary,depending on the intended use of the concrete.
