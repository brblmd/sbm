How to Calculate Density Density is how much matter is contained within a volume.A dense object weighs more than a less dense object that is the same size.An object less dense than water will float on it; one with greater density will sink.The density equation is density equals mass per unit volume or D = M V. The Density of Common Rocks and Minerals thoughtco The densities of rocks and minerals are normally expressed as specific gravity,which is the density of the rock relative to the density of water.This isn't as complex as you may think because water's density is 1 gram per cubic centimeter or 1 g cm 3.
