Rb as an Alternative Cation for Templating Inorganic Lead Even though perovskite solar cells have reached 22% efficiency within a very short span,the presence of lead is a major bottleneck to its commercial appliion.Tin and germanium based perovskites failed to be viable replacements due to the instability of their +2 oxidation states.Antimony could be a possible replacement,forming perovskites with structure A3M2X9. Rb Rubidium GTK Rb Rubidium Introduction Rubidium is a member of the alkali metal group 1 of the periodic table,along with Li,Na,K and Cs.The element has an atomic number of 37,an atomic mass of 85,one oxidation state (+1) and two naturally occurring isotopes (85Rb and 87Rb),of which 85Rb is the most abundant at 72% of the mass. Rubidium Encyclopedia Rubidium is a soft,silvery alkali metal that reacts explosively with water.The word rubidium is derived from &quotrubidus&quot (Latin for &quotdeepest red&quot),due.to the deep red lines observed by Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchoff during their analysis of lepidolite ore using a spectroscope in 1861. Rubidium Facts,Symbol,Discovery,Properties,Uses What is Rubidium.Rubidium (pronunciation rooBIDeeem [2]),represented by the chemical symbol (molecular formula) Rb [1,12],is a soft element belonging to the family of alkali metals [1,2].It has 29 isotopes with known halflives the mass numbers of which range from 74 to 102.
