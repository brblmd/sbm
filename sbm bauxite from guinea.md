Bright future for bauxite industry in Guinea M i N M E T Guineaâ€™s bauxite mining development CRU CBG Bauxite (Aluminium Ore) Mining Operations Mining The largest single producer of bauxite (aluminium ore) in the world,Cie des Bauxites de Guin&#233e's (CBG) operations are loed in the west of Guinea,close to the border with GuineaBissau.Since opening in 1973,the operations produced over 260Mt of bauxite for export. Why is Guinea Bauxite Considered the Best in the World Aug 02,2017&nbsp&#0183&#32One of the interesting features of Guinea bauxite is the natural low reactive silica content (&lt2%),which makes this most favorable for alumina production in the world.Further lateritic bauxite of Guinea is basically gibbisitc in nature with less than 2% boehmite,absolutely suitable for low temperature alumina refinery.
