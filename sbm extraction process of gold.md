Elution and Carbon Reactivation Resource book During the CIL process,gold is leached from the ore using an alkaline cyanide solution.The resulting gold cyanide complex ions are then concentrated and separated from the slurry by adsorbing onto activated carbon.Elution is the next step in the process,whereby the adsorption of the gold cyanide complex onto carbon is reversed. Gold Extraction Mining Goldfo Extraction of Gold by the Amalgam Process.The amalgam process is the oldest technical method of extracting gold and was used in antiquity.With the amalgam process the gold bearing rock is likewise crushed to fine sand.Afterwards mercury is added to the rock dust.Gold has the property that enables it to join to the surface of the mercury.
