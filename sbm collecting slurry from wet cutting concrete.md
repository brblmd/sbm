What Is The Proper Method For Concrete Slurry Disposal? In the construction industry,sometimes dealing with concrete slurry is unavoidable.What is concrete slurry exactly? It is the mixture of water and concrete solids that result from concrete grinding,cutting,or coring.Unfortunately,concrete slurry waste is prohibited from being dumped straight down the drain,due to its harmful nature.
