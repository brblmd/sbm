EFFECT OF FLY ASH AND QUARRY DUST AS A PARTIAL to study the effect of partial replacement of fine aggregates by quarry dust and cement by fly ash on cement concrete.1.2 NEED FOR INVESTIGATION Quarry Dust These residues are generally less than 1% aggregate production in the normal concrete.The introduction of quarry dust for mixing is limited due to its high fineness. Where to Buy Stone Dust And What It Is,How to Use It The machine has a screen that traps the larger material (that is,the crushed stone).The smaller material or &quotscreenings&quot falls through the screen.Depending on the size of the holes in the screen used,it can be so fine in texture that it is basically a powder.This is what you are buying as &quotstone dust.&quot But it may go by other names,such as: Effect of Fly Ash on Mortar Mixes with Quarry Dust as Fine Abstract.This paper presents the results of an experimental investigation carried out to evaluate the compressive strength and transverse strength of 1 : 3 mortar mixes in which natural sand was replaced with 20%,50%,and 100% quarry dust by weight which were further modified by partially replacing cement with four percentages (15%,20%,25%,and 30%) of low calcium fly ash. Partial Replacement of Sand by Quarry Dust in Concrete investigated the partial replacement of sand with quarry dust.Initially cement concrete cube was studied with various proportions of cement concrete + quarry dust (M 20,AND M25).The experimental results showed that the addition of quarry dust as fine aggregate ratio of 30%,40% and 50% was found to enhance the compressive properties.

Study of Concrete Involving Use of Quarry dust as Partial increase in quarry dust content.Quarry dust particles absorbed more water as compared to sand and thus negatively impacting the workability of concrete mix.Slump was minimum for the concrete mixture containing 40% quarry dust in place of fine aggregates.The variation of slump with quarry dust content is depicted in Fig.3. UTILISATION OF AS GENERATED QUARRY DUST AS A FINE tables 2 and 3,mixes with quarry dust as fine aggregate records higher compressive strength than those that had sand as a fine aggregate for both grades 25 and 30.Quarry dust being a generated material rather than a natural aggregate is well graded and has a rougher surface texture due to crushing. Partial Replacement of Sand with Quarry Dust in Quarry dust,a byproduct from the crushing process during quarrying activities is one of such materials.Granite fines or rock dust is a byproduct obtained during crushing of granite rocks and is also called quarry dust.
