sbm typical weight of 1m3 concreteHow Much Does a Cubic Meter of Soil Weigh? Reference One cubic meter of soil weighs between 1.2 and 1.7 metric tonnes,or between 1,200 and 1,700 kilograms.These metric figures convert to between 2,645 and 3,747 pounds,or between 2.6 tons and 3.7 tons,per cubic meter.Loose topsoil is lighter,and compacted topsoil is heavier.Moisture content also affects density and weight of soil. Nominal Weight of Standard Concrete Concrete 2008812&ensp&#0183&enspQuestion: What's the nominal weight of standard concrete? Answer: Anyone who has ever moved it by the shovelful will tell you fresh concrete is heavy,but just how heavy it is depends on the mix proportions and the particular ingredients.A good rule of thumb for most concrete mixtures is 150 pounds per cubic foot.If you fill a 5gallon bucket you've moved nearly 100 pounds of concrete.
