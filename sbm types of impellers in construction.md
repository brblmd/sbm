CHAPTER 5 CENTRIFUGAL PUMP IMPELLER VANE PROFILE The vane profiles can be of different types and the designer has the discretion to choose the type of curve to be drawn.The vane profile for the impeller of the pump considered as model in this work is a multiple curvature profile with four different radii of curvature with four different centers as shown in Figure 5.2. Pump Types Guide Find the right pump for the job A positive displacement (PD) pump is a general name for a pump type that does not have impellers,but rather relies on rotating or reciproing parts to directly push the liquid in an enclosed volume,until enough pressure is built up to move the liquid into the discharge system.Materials of construction that can handle the abrasive Impellers ChemAlone Oct 24,2017&nbsp&#0183&#32Impellers Impellers are most widely used Agitatiors,among all types,Straight Blade and InterMig Impellers are discussed in this post.Straight Blade Impeller Cleveland Eastern offers a wide range of mixing impeller designs for laboratory,pilot plant and production blending.Sizes range from 3&quot diameter propellers to 10' diameter special purpose impellers.
