sbm blog about gold mining and ore processingGold extraction Wikipedia Gold extraction refers to the processes required to extract gold from its ores.This may require a combination of comminution,mineral processing,hydrometallurgical,and pyrometallurgical processes to be performed on the ore.Gold mining from alluvium ores was once achieved by techniques associated with placer mining such as simple gold panning and sluicing,resulting in direct recovery of Gold Cyanidation The resulting liquid is collected at the bottom,and the gold is chemically extracted.Heap leaching extracts less of the gold than processing the ore in a mill,but is much cheaper.There are a few alternatives to cyanide for processing low quality ores but none are employed very widely to date (1).
