Tapasya: Machines for granulation,milling,blending and These may include intense mixing,dustfree transfer of powders,and large volumes for wet or dry materials.Established in 1962,Tapasya has accrued more than five decades of experience in granulation,drying,milling,blending,coating and pelletising processes. Wet Granulation Process for Tablet Manufacturing Production Wet granulation involves the massing of a mix of dry primary powder particles using a granulating fluid.The fluid contains a solvent which can be removed by drying,and should be nontoxic.Typical solvents include water,ethanol and isopropanol and methylene chloride either alone or in combination.
