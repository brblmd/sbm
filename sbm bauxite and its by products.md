What is Bauxite? (with pictures) 12&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Bauxite is a mineral bearing rock named for the region in France where it was first identified.One of the key components of bauxite is aluminum oxides,which can be processed to make aluminum products.Bauxite is mined in several regions of the world by a number of companies that are interested in aluminum products. Bayer Process: Manufacturing Of Alumina Making of Alumina Its molar mass is 101.96 g mol.The Bayer Process: Alumina is the main components of bauxite,so bauxite is refined in order to produce Alumina.The Bayer process is the principal way for producing alumina by refining Bauxite.Bauxite other than with 3060percentage of aluminium oxide contains mixture of silica,iron oxides and titanium dioxide. Mining and Refining Process The bauxite residue sinks to the bottom of the settling tanks,then is transferred to the washing tanks,where it undergoes a series of washing stages to recover the caustic soda (which is reused in the digestion process).Further separation of the pregnant liquor from the bauxite residue is performed utilising a series of security filters.
