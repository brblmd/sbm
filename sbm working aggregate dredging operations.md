Dredging Wikipedia Dredging is the operation of removing material from one part of the water environment and reloing it to another.In all but a few situations the excavation is undertaken by a specialist floating plant,known as a dredger.Dredging is carried out in many different loions and for many different purposes,but the main objectives are usually to recover material that has some value or use,or About Us Experience Since 1982 Aggregate Dredge Solutions Jochen's family has been in the Sand and Gravel industry since the 1930's with four different operations in Germany.With multiple inventions to his name,Jochen has remained at the forefront of the dredging industry by using the latest componentry and technology.Aggregate Dredge Solutions provides complete dredging solutions for the Agg industry.
