Characterization of Recycled Coarse Aggregate (RCA) via a Recycled coarse aggregate (RCA) made from waste concrete is not a suitable structural material as it has high absorption of cement mortar,which adheres on the aggregate surface and on the tiny cracks thereon.Therefore,when using RCA made from waste concrete,much water must be added with the concrete,and slump loss occurs when transporting.
