Rock fragmentation control in opencast blasting 1.Introduction.Rock fragmentation distribution influences a range of mining and milling processes including load and haul rates,crushing and grinding performance and ore recovery in beneficiation processes (Michaud et al.1997).In opencast mining,where blasting is employed for excavation,the overall cost effectiveness of the production operations is compatible with optimization of Quora A place to share knowledge and better understand Quora is a place to gain and share knowledge.It's a platform to ask questions and connect with people who contribute unique insights and quality answers.This empowers people to learn from each other and to better understand the world. Optimized extraction of dimension stone blocks stone mining is,for example,when the fragmentation into rectangular blocks is deﬁned by a natural orthogonal fracture system.But in many cases,deposits of natural building stone are affected by a distinct variability of the orientation of joints,leading to irregular,often acuteangled blocks,whereby each block then needs individual
