Mining in Iran Wikipedia Mining in Iran is underdeveloped,yet the country is one of the most important mineral producers in the world,ranked among 15 major mineralrich countries,holding some 68 types of minerals,37 billion tonnes of proven reserves and more than 57 billion tonnes of potential reserves worth $770 billion in 2014.Mineral production contributes only 0.6 per cent to the country's GDP. Bauxite and alumina U.S.Geological Survey Publiions The United States is reliant upon imports for nearly all of the bauxite that it consumes.Small amounts of bauxite and bauxitic clays are produced in Alabama,Arkansas and Georgia for nonmetallurgical uses.Metallurgicalgrade bauxite (crude dry) imports in 2012 totaled 10.3 Mt (11.3 million st),8 percent more than the quantity imported in 2011. Dzhezkazgan and associated sandstone copper deposits of Sandstonehosted copper (sandstone Cu) deposits occur within a 200km reach of the northern ChuSarysu basin of central Kazakhstan (Dzhezkazgan and ZhamanAibat deposits,and the Zhilandy group of deposits).The deposits consist of Cu sulfide minerals as intergranular cement and grain replacement in 10 orebearing members of sandstone and conglomerate within a 600 to 1,000m thick Hydraulic Design Manual: References ♦ SoilCement Riprap,US Geological Survey Scientific Investigations Report 2008 5084,Austin,TX.(TxDOT 055212) Rainfall Frequency Atlas of the United States for Durations from 30 Minutes to 24 Hours and Return Periods from 1 to 100 Years,US Department of Commerce,Weather Bureau Iron and steel industry in the United States Wikipedia In 2014,the United States was the world's thirdlargest producer of raw steel (after China and Japan),and the sixthlargest producer of pig iron.The industry produced 29 million metric tons of pig iron and 88 million tons of steel.Most iron and steel in the United States is now made from iron and steel scrap,rather than iron ore.

Nova Cimangola plans new cement factory in Luanda,Angola (Angola) — Angolan cement manufacturer Nova Cimangola has announced its plans to construct a new cement factory in Luanda,Angola.Nova Cimangola will invest $365 million in the facility which will have a capacity to produce two million tons of cement per year.
