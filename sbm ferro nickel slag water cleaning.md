Nonferrous Slags Material Description User Guidelines Nickel Slag.Aircooled nickel slag is brownishblack in color.It crushes to angular particles but has a smooth,glassy texture.The specific gravity of aircooled nickel slag may be as high as 3.5 (15),while the absorption is quite low (0.37 percent).(3) The unit weight of nickel slag is somewhat higher than that of conventional aggregate. SIPS2017 Determination of the High Temperature Melting The industrial manufacturing of ferronickel in electric furnaces produces large amounts of slag with strong acidic character and high melting points,which seriously stresses the furnace refractory.In this study,measurements by a hot stage microscope served for the determination of melting behaviour of synthetically produced ferronickel slags on magnesia as refractory material.
