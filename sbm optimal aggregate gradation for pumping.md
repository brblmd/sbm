Section 7: Concrete Materials Texas Department of Section 7: Concrete Materials Anchor: #i1014270 The particle size distribution or gradation of the aggregate is an important characteristic.Coarse aggregate Grades 2 and 3 listed in Item 421 are typically used in concrete pavements and have large nominal maximum aggregate size.pumping,and placing properties. grading of aggregate for concrete mix For best pumpability,coarse aggregate grading should fall in the center of the gradation specifiions.Porosity will affect pumpability if a significant amount of mix water is absorbed by the aggregate during pumping.When absorption causes problems,one solution is to thoroughly wet the aggregate stockpiles before batching the concrete. Mix Design and Pumped Concrete Civil Engineering In absence of fine aggregate of required grading they should be blended with selected sands to produce desired grading,and then combine with coarse aggregates to get a typed grading as per Table 3.(d) Pumping Before the pumping of concrete is started,the conduit should be primed by pumping a batch of mortar through the line to lubrie it. What Makes Concrete Pumpable? Concrete Construction Magazine For best pumpability,coarse aggregate grading should fall in the center of the gradation specifiions.Porosity will affect pumpability if a significant amount of mix water is absorbed by the aggregate during pumping.When absorption causes problems,one solution is to thoroughly wet the aggregate stockpiles before batching the concrete.
