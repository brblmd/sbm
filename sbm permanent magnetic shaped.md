Magnet Grades K&ampJ Magnetics The magnetic field strength is a measurement of the magnetic field's strength and direction at a particular point near the magnet.It is expressed in Gauss or Tesla (1 Tesla = 10,000 Gauss).It depends on the size,shape and grade of the magnet,where the measurement is performed,and the presence of any other magnets or ferromagnetic materials nearby. Permanent Magnets Magnetism and Electromagnetism The iron will magnetize in such a way as to incorporate the magnetic flux lines into its shape,which attracts it toward the permanent magnet,no matter which pole of the permanent magnet is offered to the iron: The previously unmagnetized iron becomes magnetized as it is brought closer to the permanent magnet.

Unique Motor Uses Only Permanent Magnets No Electric An electric motor that uses permanent magnets does not have field windings that serve as electromagnets on the stator frame.Instead,the permanent magnets on the stator frame provide the magnetic fields that interact with the rotor field to produce torque.This eliminates the need to power the stator,thereby reducing electrical energy Electromagnet Wikipedia The main advantage of an electromagnet over a permanent magnet is that the magnetic field can be quickly changed by controlling the amount of electric current in the winding.However,unlike a permanent magnet that needs no power,an electromagnet requires a continuous supply of current to maintain the magnetic field.
