SCHULER customized firstrate technology in all areas of System solutions for minting technology.Schuler supports minting technology with innovative developments and numerous patents.For example,at the turn of the 19th Century,it was possible to produce up to 60 coins per minute on Schuler presses an astonishing achievement for the time. Cold,Warm,&amp Hot Forging What's the Difference Compared with cold forging,warm forging has the potential advantages of reduced tooling loads,reduced forging press loads,increased steel ductility,elimination of need to anneal prior to forging,and favorable asforged properties that can eliminate heat treatment.Hot Bearing Materials Ceramics,Chrome Steels,Stainless The most common material used to produce the load carrying components in precision ball bearings,roller bearings,and tapered roller bearings is 52100 chrome steel.These components are the bearings inner and outer rings,balls and rollers.The chemical composition of this steel has high carbon and about 1.5% chromium content. Metal Forging Manufacturing Process Metal forging is a metal forming process that involves applying compressive forces to a work piece to deform it,and create a desired geometric change to the material.The forging process is very important in industrial metal manufacture,particularly in the extensive iron and steel manufacturing industry.
