Minerals are materials that meet five requirements.They are: 1) naturally occurring,2) inorganic,3) solids,4) with a definite chemical composition,and,5) an ordered internal structure. Mining Claims There are two types of mineral entries,mill sites and tunnel sites.Mill Sites: A mill site must be located on nonmineral land.Its purpose is to either (1) support a lode or placer mining claim operation or (2) support itself independent of any particular claim. mineral ball mills manufacturers,supplier A ball mill mineral can be used to grind both wet and dry products and there are two types of ball mills namely over fall type and grate type depending on the different ways they discharge materials.There are also many types of grinding media and there properties are density,size,composition and hardness.
