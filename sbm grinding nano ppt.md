PowerPoint Presentation If simple,turning,lapping,grinding and polishing.Asphere needs different set of operations.Freeform needs diamond turning,hand polishing.Designs for special tool must be done during mold design.Finishing.Abrasive lapping and polishing.PowerPoint Presentation Last modified by: Micro and nano grinding SlideShare Nov 16,2016&nbsp&#0183&#32Micro and nano grinding 1.Micro and Nano Grinding 7ME6.1A (Part III) Er.Mohit Ostwal Assistant Professor Department of Mechanical Engineering Jodhpur Institute of Engineering and TechnologyCoed 2.Conventional Grinding • Horizontal Wheel surface grinding • Vertical spindle surface grinding 3. ELID Grinding Grinding (Abrasive Cutting) Machining Nanosurface finish can be achieved by using ductile mode machining on hard and brittle materials.The results show that the ELID grinding can produce ductile surfaces without any subsurface damage,which eliminates the lapping and polishing processes. NANOPARTICLES capacitors.Metal oxide ceramic nanoparticles can also be used to create thin layers,whether crystalline or amorphous.Ceramic nanoparticles,like metallic nanoparticles,can also be formed into coatings and bulk materials at lower temperatures than their nonnano counterparts,reducing manufacturing costs. No Slide Title Deliverables Better understanding of the factors that influence nanomilling and dispersion Significance of grinding aid adsorption Influence of particle particle interactions Develop selection criteria of grinding aids for nanomilling of water insoluble compounds.
