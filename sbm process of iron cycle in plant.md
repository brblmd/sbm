Hydrogen production by steam iron process The process operates two stages: during the reduction step the iron ores are reduced by synthesis or biomass gas,which is thereby oxidised to a lean gas with low remaining CO (6 8%) and H 2 (ca.6%) content.In the subsequent oxidation step,the iron ore is re oxidised by water vapour yielding an hydrogen rich fuel gas. Steel manufacture 2019 10 31&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;An important feature of iron making is that the process is continuous.When a sufficient quantity of molten iron accumulates in the hearth of the blast furnace,it is tapped off into ladles for steel making.As slag builds up on the surface of the molten metal it,too,is tapped off at regular intervals through a separate ‘notch’ or taphole. Iron and Steel Manufacturing IFC Iron and Steel Manufacturing process,the iron from the blast furnace is converted to steel in a basic oxygen furnace ter plant.• Recover energy How Is Cast Iron Made? Sciencing Cast iron that has not cooled evenly produces a low quality cast.Other problems faced during the cast iron process include contamination of the iron,gas porosity (the forming of bubbles in the iron),and problems with the fluidity of the metal.The casting process is an art that must be examined and experienced to be fully understood.
