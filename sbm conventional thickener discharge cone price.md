Thickeners Mineral Processing &amp Metallurgy To illustrate the differences between these thickener types.Figure 18.5 depicts underflow produced by the thickener compared with the relative yield stress of the material.Highrate thickeners produce the lowest density and yield stress (&lt20 Pa).The highest yield stress underflow is produced by deepcone thickeners and can reach over 150 Pa. Clarifier an overview ScienceDirect Topics The circular class of high capacity thickener is similar in general form to a conventional circular basin thickener,but cylinder diameters are limited to between 4 and 18 m (see Figure 1.4).Units are constructed from steel and include a cylindrical top portion,an inverted cone bottom section and an angled rake system mounted on a central Tailingsfo Thickened Tailings Storage A discussion In conventional tailings deposition the beach slope is very low,often around 1% (less than 1 degree) and facility design can be flexible if there is a slight variation in this parameter.However,for thickened tailings where the variation is often greater with increased beach slopes,this can have a big impact on embankment design heights.
