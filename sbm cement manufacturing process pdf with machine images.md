Manufacturing Process of Portland cement can be made by following two different processes a dry one and a wet one.Joseph Aspdin first made portland cement in his kitchen stove in England in the 19th century.Lime and silica make up approximately 85% of portland cement.The materials that are commonly used are limestone,shells,chalk,shale,clay,slate,silica sand,and iron ore. 1,F.Y.Hagos2,3,* and S.M.Atnaw4 201639&ensp&#0183&enspin the cement production process [13],35% of it is lost to the environment as waste heat [10,15,17].This concern is not just limited to the production cost,but also to the consequence on the global warming and pollution,which is the biggest challenge of the 21st century.Cement production is one of the major contributors of CO 2 [3].
