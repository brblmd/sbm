Calcination Wikipedia 20191025&ensp&#0183&enspIn limestone calcination,a decomposition process,the chemical reaction is CaCO 3 → CaO + CO 2 (g).The standard Gibbs free energy of reaction is approximated as ΔG&#176 r = 177,100 − 158 T (J mol).The standard free energy of reaction is 0 in this case when the temperature,T,is equal to 1121 K,or 848 &#176C.Oxidation.In some cases,calcination of a metal results in oxidation of the metal. Lime Treated Soil Construction Manual Lime Stabilization Graymont Figure 4: Lime flocculating clay.3.Stabilization: When adequate quantities of lime and water are added,the pH of the soil quickly increases to above 10.5,which enables the clay particles to break down.Determining the amount of lime necessary is part of the design process and is approximated by tests such as the Eades&nbsp A Study on the Manufacture of Clinker Using Low Grade Limestone.
