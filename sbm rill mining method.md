Inside block caving: the deep mining method of the future, The role of block caving Although the caving mining system was initially used for shallow orebodies,it has recently been applied at depths of 2km underground According to Suorineni,“caving heights have also increased drastically from about 200m to 500m”,creating so called ‘super caves’“There is insufficient experience caving in these environments,” he adds,which is a.
