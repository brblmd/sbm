Beneficiation Wikipedia In the mining industry or extractive metallurgy,beneficiation is any process that improves (benefits) the economic value of the ore by removing the gangue minerals,which results in a higher grade product (concentrate) and a waste stream (tailings).Examples of beneficiation processes include froth flotation and gravity&nbsp;. Derryginagh Barite Project,Ireland Sunrise Resources plc The Study considered processing of the ore by means of gravity methods.The process selection includes crushing,ball milling,desliming and size classification and gravity beneficiation using a combination of spirals,shaking tables and multi gravity separators.The final concentrate grade was estimated at 98.5% barite&nbsp;. Barytes British Geological Survey 2.2 Processing.Following initial crushing,some barytes is sold as &#39;direct shipping ore&#39;,if it is sufficiently pure,to be processed for addition to drilling fluids at plants.The barytes is then either dried and sold as a powder or processed further.beneficiation from an operation such as Cavendish Mill (Glebe Mines Ltd.).
