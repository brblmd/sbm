Seal Air is used to prevent coal dust particles coming out of the pulverizer,secondly the seal air is also used in rotary belt feeders to prevent the hot primary air from entering bunker via feeder route which can cause fire,therefore as a rule seal air is kept at a higher pressure as compared to the primary air. Extension of Cogeneration Capability by Increasing The coal pipe size was originally 12" except for the horizontal run which was 10&quot to prevent coal dust deposition.Each pipe had an individual coal plug valve with a manual drive.The primary air flow through the pulverizer is controlled by means of a tandem line damper,installed on each pair of coal pipes,downstream of the coal valves. coal pulveriser diagram rockcreations.co.za bowl mill coal pulverizer YouTube.Jun 20,2013.Pall Corporation Raw Coal.Feeder.Raw Coal.Bunker.To Boiler Furnace.Raw Coal.Feeder.Exhauster Figure 1.
