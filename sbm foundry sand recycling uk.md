sbm foundry sand recycling ukTHE RECLAMATION AND RECYCLING OF CLAYBONDED FOUNDRY The cost to the industry to purchase over 1 million tonnes of new sand and its subsequent disposal is over 32 million annually.There is increasing interest from the foundry industry to develop more cost effective ways of recycling of claybonded foundry sands by applying techniques and approaches used by the mineral processing industry. Beneficial Uses of Spent Foundry Sands Sustainable The metal casting industry generates spent foundry sands.Foundries purchase new,virgin sand to make casting molds,and the sand is reused numerous times within the foundry.This reuse eventually renders the sand unsuitable for use in casting molds,and a portion of the sand is Aggregate,Mineral and Agricultural Equipment McLanahan McLanahan Corporation designs and manufactures aggregate,mineral and agricultural equipment.Headquartered in Hollidaysburg,PA USA since 1835.
