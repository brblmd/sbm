Dimensional Stone Testing testingengineers Over the years we have established a great deal of expertise in evaluation of dimensional stone.Our experienced staff utilizing the latest laboratory equipment can set up tests specific to certain appliions,or can perform standard ASTM* test procedures for different types of dimensional stone.What Types of Dimensional Stone are Tested? Marble ASTM C880 : Standard Test Method for Flexural Strength of Stone tests shall be made when pertinent for the situation when the load is perpendicular to the bedding plane and when the load is parallel to the bedding plane.As required,the flexural tests shall also be conducted under wet conditions.The values stated in inch Stone Testing Provides Valuable Information and Technical stone industry.MIA publishes the Dimension Stone Design Manual,which is a helpful tool for designing with stone.The manual can be ordered through the MIA web site,TILE 90 June July 2007 Figure 2:ASTM C880 Flexural Strength test,due to the constant bending moment region created by the 4point DIMENSION STONE: THE LATEST TRENDS IN EXPLORATION dimension stone as "naturally occurring rock material cut,shaped or selected for use in blocks,slabs,sheets or other construction units of specialised shapes and sizes"[4].A dimension stone block thus has value as a result of its dimensions and appearance,underlain by a set of minimum ASTM C880 C880M18 Standard Test Method for Flexural ASTMC880C880M18Standard Test Method for Flexural Strength of Dimension Stone 1.1 This test method covers the procedure for determining the flexural st Customer Service: 212 642 4980 1.2 Stone tests shall be made when pertinent for the situation when the load is perpendicular to the bedding plane and when the load is parallel to the The time of tests : Abrasion resistance Stone Specialist Oct 12,2011&nbsp&#0183&#32These tests are closely related to the American abrasion resistance test,ASTM C241,which also takes the density into account to calculate a hardness value.The American standards for dimension stone provide a number of minimum limits required for different types of stone to be considered acceptable. About Limestone &amp Sandstone Salado Texas Quarries **Based on ASTM tests C97,C99,and C170.Table represents summarized averages for actual tests.Full results,including range of findings,are available upon request.Stone is a product of nature.Because of this,actual results of colors,weights and coverages may vary. Dimension Stone Statistics and Information Dimension stone can be defined as natural rock material quarried for the purpose of obtaining blocks or slabs that meet specifiions as to size (width,length,and thickness) and shape.Color,grain texture and pattern,and surface finish of the stone are normal requirements. Lab Testing Standard Test Methods: ASTM C97 C97M Absorption and Bulk Specific Gravity of Dimension Stone: These test methods cover the tests for determining the absorption and bulk specific gravity of all types of dimension stone,except slate. Stone Testing Rupture of Dimension Stone,ASTM C170,Standard Test Method for Compressive Strength of Dimension Stone,and ASTM C880,Standard Test Method for Flexural Strength of Dimension Stone test results are not suitable to use for horizontal (floor) appliions where the thickness of the stone tile being used is less than 1&#188&quot.
