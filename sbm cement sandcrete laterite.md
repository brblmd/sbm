sbm cement sandcrete lateriteStrength of Ternary Blended Cement Sandcrete 201356&ensp&#0183&enspfor sandcrete making.The compressive strength of ternary blended cement sandcrete containing Afikpo rice husk ash and sawdust ash was specifically investigated.The successful utilization of rice husk ash and sawdust ash in ternary combination with OPC for making sandcrete would further add value to these wastes.Moreover, Cost of building materials in Nigeria (2019) PropertyPro Cost of building materials in Nigeria(2018) vary although it is higher by 15% than imported building materials.Nigerians overseas can benefit from the market survey to estimate a budget for construction cost at home.This market survey provides details in relation to brand,size,and price which can be used to make adequate planning towards upcoming building projects in the country by been Strength of Blended Cement Sandcrete &amp Soilcrete Blocks 2013520&ensp&#0183&enspKamiyo (2011) reported thatsandcrete blocks made with RHAblended cement had lower heat storage capacity and lower thermal mass than 100% OPC sandcrete blocks.They explained that the increased thermal effusivity of the sandcrete block with RHA content is an advantage over 100% OPC sandcrete block as it enhances human thermal comfort. Costs of Alternative Methods of Acquiring Sandcrete 201537&ensp&#0183&enspcement,sandcrete block is made of only fine aggregate (sand) mixed with cement.The sand and cement mixture is in the proportion of 6:1 (British Standards Institution,1970).Specifiions for moulding sandcrete blocks stipulate that the block is generally to be made in accordance with BS 2028.Sandcrete blocks are made in three sizes in Nigeria. Strength,durability and cost effectiveness of cement Strength and durability of cementstabilized laterite hollow blocks made with laterite soils at three different loions in Edo State were studied.To this end,blocks were produced with water content at about the optimum moisture with varying percentages of cement from 3% to 15% at 2% increments and compactive pressures ranging from 3.44 N mm2 to 17.20 N mm2.

Durability performance of concrete containing laterite Studies found that the use of 20 to 30% of laterite aggregates,as partial replacement for coarse aggregates,results in concrete with the targeted strength.However,the effect of laterite aggregate content on the durability performance of this concrete is unknown.
