Strength,durability and cost effectiveness of cement Strength and durability of cementstabilized laterite hollow blocks made with laterite soils at three different loions in Edo State were studied.To this end,blocks were produced with water content at about the optimum moisture with varying percentages of cement from 3% to 15% at 2% increments and compactive pressures ranging from 3.44 N mm2 to 17.20 N mm2.

Durability performance of concrete containing laterite Studies found that the use of 20 to 30% of laterite aggregates,as partial replacement for coarse aggregates,results in concrete with the targeted strength.However,the effect of laterite aggregate content on the durability performance of this concrete is unknown.
