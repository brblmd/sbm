ACI Mix Design Whereas strength depends on the w c ratio,economy depends on the percentage of aggregate present that would still give a workable mix.➢ The aim of the designer should always be to get concrete mixtures of optimum strength at minimum cement content and acceptable workability.ACI Mix Design.ACI Mix Design. What Are the Different Grades of Concrete? Reference Concrete grades are determined by concrete's compressive strength 28 days after it has been poured.The strength is measured in psi,or pounds per square inch.The greater the psi rating on a mix of concrete,the stronger the concrete will be after it has been poured and set.
