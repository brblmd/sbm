Copper vs.Cuprous Oxide: What is the Difference? Jul 17,2015&nbsp&#0183&#32When copper is exposed to water molecules (two hydrogen,one oxygen),this free electron is transferred to a neighboring oxygen atom,bonding it into a molecule.If only one atom of copper bonds to an oxygen molecule,it is called cupric oxide.If two copper atoms bond to an oxygen atom,it is cuprous oxide.

Copper Refining: Explained StepbyStep In refining copper,the metal is melted down in a reverberatory furnace in a more or less oxidizing atmosphere and then further subjected to an oxidizing smelting in order to eliminate the common impurities,most of which have a stronger affinity for oxygen than has copper.In these operations some of the copper is oxidized to cuprous oxide and dissolved by the metal bath.
